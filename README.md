##Game of Life Cucumber Features

Building a Conways' Game of Life simulator is a great way to practice different techniques in the language of your choice. This git repository contains a set of cucumber features that describe the rules of Conway's Game of Life. I've also included a few standard, larger patterns that you can use to check multiple generation evolution.

##Setup Visual Studio Pre-requisites
* Install Visual Studio 2010,2012, or 2013
* Install <a href="http://www.specflow.org/">Specflow</a>
* Restore Nuget packages
* Run Specflow tests (with MS Test Runner or resharper)

##How to use

Fork this repo on github, clone to your local machine and start working. Thanks to the cucumber team's efforts in integrating cucumber with multiple languages, these features can be used to drive development in many different languages, most likely your favorite one.
